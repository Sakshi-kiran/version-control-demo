# Version Control Demo: To-Do List Application

## **Project Overview**
A simple command-line To-Do List application developed as a learning project to practice Git and GitHub for version control, including feature branching, pull requests, and tagging.

## **Why This Repository?**
This repository consolidates my learning journey in DevOps and version control, providing a practical example of how to manage a project using Git and GitHub best practices.

## **Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of version control, including feature branching, pull requests, and effective collaboration in software development.

## **Usage**
- **Add To-Dos**: Users can add tasks to their list through the command line.
- **View To-Dos**: Users can view the current list of to-dos at any time.
- **Quit**: Users can exit the application by typing `quit`.

## **Version Control Features**
This project showcases:
- **Feature Branching**: Development of new features in separate branches.
- **Pull Requests**: Merging changes into the main branch using pull requests for code review.
- **Tagging**: Tagging specific releases for easier tracking, such as `v1.0`.

## **Learning Journey**
Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of Git and GitHub, improving my skills in version control and collaboration within development teams.

## **Example Usage**
```bash
What would you like to do? (add/view/quit): add
Enter a new to-do: Buy groceries
'Buy groceries' has been added to your to-do list.
